##Plot logistic regression

##1: fit logistic regression model
model <- glm(DidFledge ~ Dist, family = "binomial", data = data)

##2: define new data frame that contains the predictor variable (Dist)
newdata <- data.frame(Dist = seq(min(data$Dist), max(data$Dist), len = 500))

##3: use fitted model to predict values of response variable (DidFledge)
newdata$DidFledge = predict(model, newdata, type = "response")

##4: plot logistic regression curve
plot(DidFledge ~ Dist, data = data, col = "black")
lines(DidFledge ~ Dist, newdata, lwd = 2)
