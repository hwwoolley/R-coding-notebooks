#probability of survival/probability of dying is called the odds
#Output of glm is called log odds; y = log (pi/(1-pi)); or y = log(prob.survival/1-prob.survival)
#pi = probability of success; 1-pi = probability of failure
#from summary, Sexmale coeff = -2.5 so the log odds of survival is reduced by 2.5 if male

#convert log odds to odds by taking the exponential of the coefficients

#Sexmale reduces your odds of survival by a factor of 0.08 compared to female. This is called the odds ratio
